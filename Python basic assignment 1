# 1. What are the differences between operators and values in the following?

The operator are used to carryout operation for values or betweeen operands.

* = This is multiplication sign
'hello'= This string value as it is enclosed within single quite and can be double quotes as well
-87.8 = This integer value with a negative operator sign
- = This is subtraction operator 
/ = This is division operator
+ = This is a addition operator
6 = This is integer value.

 # 2. What is the difference between string and variable?

spam - Here spam is variable as it will store some kind of value within it.
'spam'- This is something a type of information that we are storing in a variable it can integer as well.

# 3. Describe three different data forms.

There Type of data forms are 
integers, floating-point numbers and complex numbers
will explain Integer and python with example
eg:
a=5  This variable is storing a integer value.
b=5.0  This variable stores a float value as it include decimal values as well.
Complex number are written in form of x+yj where x is real number and y is imaginery part
eg
type(5+3j)
output is complex

# 4. What makes up an expression? What are the functions of all expressions?

Operation between minimum two makes up a experation
Expression can consist of numbers,fraction,variable and operators
Function of expression are :
To solve a mathematical problem
To derive out a result when there is operation between numbers.
There are three type of expression:Algebraic,Fractional and Arithmetic

# 5. In this chapter, assignment statements such as spam = 10 were added. What's the difference between a declaration and an expression?

Declaration means binding a variable to its datatype but declaration of variable is not required in python.
while a expression is sequence of operands and operators, if some operation is performed on spam variable suppose
if some number is added to it
Code:
Spam=10
Spammer=Spam+10 (this is a expression)


# 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

#Here variable bacon contain a integer value.
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

# 7. What should the values of the following two terms be?

print('spam' +'spamspam')
print('spam'*3)
#output will be same for both of these values.

# 8. Why is it that eggs is a true variable name but 100 is not?

eggs can be assigned a values.
100 is a value that can be assigned to eggs variable but the egg cannot be assigned to 100
it will result in a error.

100=egg

# 9. Which of the following three functions may be used to convert a value to an integer, a floating-point number, or a string?

a=10
print(int(a))#int function convert value to int
b=str(a)# function convert any value to string
print(b,type(b))
print(float(a))# Float function convert value to float

# 10. What is the error caused by this expression? What would you do about it?

'I have eaten'  + '99' +  'burritos.'
#99 value to be converted into string,string concatenation should have all values as string only.
#we can use str function also to convert 99 to string
